*A brief intro about myself*

### INTRO


  - :rabbit2:  Hi~, my name is __Zhanheng Gao__ (*You can also call me __Snage Gao__*), a China student with a undergraduate degree from [__Huazhong U. of Science and Technology__](https://www.hust.edu.cn/).  

  - :book:  After four years of study in [__School of Electronic Information and Communication__](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/), I have learned multiple programming languages including `C`, `Java`, `Verilog HDL` and `Python`, as well as lots of utility softwares such as `Matlab`, `Vivado` and `Android Studio`. 

  - :art:  I am interested in variety of subjects beside coding. From art to music, I am obsessed with all the things that can bring people pleasure. Especially I have passion for poster designing and animation creating. As a result, I have skillfully mastered some software like `Photoshop` and `Powerpoint`.

  - :muscle:  To pursue an advanced degree, I took the __postgraduate examination__ months ago. Hope I can get a good result.
